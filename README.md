## Overview of analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how the new webpage we designed for Dana can be used, which will include a demonstration. I will further review one drawback to the redesign that was done. Finally, I will include two recommendations for further development. 

## Results

The banner declares the purpose of the website in clear terms: "The Truth is Out There." [image] There is an introductory paragraph at the top of the webpage with a description of the site’s purpose: a user can perform a search for UFO sightings. All of the sightings in the data file are initially displayed, and can be filtered. A user can search by date, city, state, country, and UFO shape. [image] This search feature utilizes a JavaScript function to loop through the dataset and keep results that only match the search criteria. 

## Summary 

One drawback of this webpage is that it does not have a “filter table” button, and the user is required to press Enter once they’ve entered their filter parameters. I think a button is more user friendly, and if having a user press Enter is preferred, there should be text indicating this to the user. One additional recommendation I would make is that there be a way for a user to submit their own UFO sighting to Dana. She could choose to incorporate these additional sightings into her database, which would also benefit from being cleaned up. A lot of the comments only appear partially or have typos/errors. A third recommendation for further development would be a reference page to give credit to each UFO sighting listed in the database. Where are these sourced from? Providing this information would be interesting for serious Ufologists as well as provide more context and data for skeptics.
